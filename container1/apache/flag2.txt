Congratulations on solving part 2/6! Here's your flag!
FLAG{1_d1d_n07_kn0w_4rp_c0uld_r34d_f1l35}

2 out of 6 flags acquired but where are the rest of the vulnerabilies?
Are there perhaps other systems on the network?

Please do not attack anything in the 172.x.x.x range
I mean you can, but there's nothing there, plus it's super locked down
